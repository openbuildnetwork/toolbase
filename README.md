## What is Toolbase?

Toolbase is a privacy-first, browser-native toolbase — a single platform where every tool you need lives in one place, and every operation happens entirely on your machine.

No uploads. No servers. No subscriptions. No compromises.

Whether you're compressing a PDF, analyzing a dataset, redacting secrets from config files, or building a diagram — Toolbase processes everything locally using WebAssembly. Your files never leave your browser.

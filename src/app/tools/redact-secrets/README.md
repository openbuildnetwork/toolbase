# Secret Redact Tool

## Overview

The Secret Redact Tool is a privacy-first, client-side application designed to sanitize text and files containing sensitive information. It runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly (Pyodide), ensuring that your secrets, PII, and sensitive logs never leave your device.

## Features

- **Partial/Full Redaction**: Choose to completely hide secrets or show partial hints (e.g., `sk_live_...1234`).
- **Custom Patterns**: Add custom Regex patterns or literal strings to redact.
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects common secrets (API keys, email addresses, credit cards, IP addresses, etc.).
- **File Support**: Upload `.txt`, `.log`, `.json`, `.csv` files for bulk redaction.
- **Security Audit**: Instant feedback on how many secrets were neutralized.

## Privacy Guarantee

- **No Server Uploads**: All processing happens in a Web Worker on your machine.
- **No External APIs**.
- **No Telemetry**.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React (Next.js)
- **Backend**: Python (running in WASM via Pyodide)
- **Worker**: `redact.worker.ts` handles the Python execution to keep the UI smooth.

## Usage

1. Paste text or upload a file.
2. Select redaction style (Partial/Full/Hash).
3. (Optional) Add custom keys or patterns to target.
4. Click "Redact Now".
5. Copy the sanitized output.
